    <h1>Bolognese</h1>

    <p>This homemade Bolognese sauce is dedicated to the late great Marcella Hazan. She was considered the Julia Child of Italian food. At a time when most Americans thought Bolognese was spaghetti sauce with chunks of hamburger, Marcella taught us just how magnificent this meat sauce could be. I like to toss it with some mezzi rigatoni and serve it with a little grated Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of parsley.</p>

    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li1 cup finely diced onion</li>
        <li>½ cup finely diced celery</li>
        <li>½ cup finely diced carrot</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups 2% milk</li>
        <li>2 cups white wine</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can whole Italian plum tomatoes (preferably San Marzano)</li>
        <li>2 cups water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter with olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, celery, carrot, and 1 pinch salt; cook and stir until onion turns translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <liStir ground beef into vegetables; cook and stir until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Season with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Pour milk into ground beef mixture and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring frequently, until most of the milk has evaporated and the bottom of the pan is still slightly saucy, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to medium-high and pour in white wine; cook and stir until wine has mostly evaporated, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour tomatoes with juice into a large mixing bowl; crush them with your hands until they resemble a chunky sauce. Pour tomato mixture into ground beef mixture; fill the tomato can with 2 cups water and stir into sauce. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring often, until mixture cooks down into a thick sauce, at least 3 hours but preferably 4 to 6 hours. Skim fat from the top of sauce if desired. Add more water if sauce is too thick. Taste and adjust seasonings before serving.</li>
    </ol>
